# Market-Analysis
Here I undertake mini projects in the market space and use data to drive decisions.
## Project I: RFM Analysis
In the fast-paced and ever-changing world of business, making data-driven decisions is essential for success. The Market Analysis repository aims to provide valuable analysis and insights into various aspects of the market, allowing stakeholders to gain a deeper understanding of their industries and make informed decisions.

## Project II: Entertainment Industry Stock Analysis 
This project is focused on exploring stocks in the entertainment and streaming services sector. I will analyze major players like Netflix, Disney, Roku, and Spotify, visualizing their recent performance and daily returns. Additionally, I'll investigate correlations between stock prices, implement a moving average crossover strategy, and conduct a sector analysis to compare the performance within different sectors.
